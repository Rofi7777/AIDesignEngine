📘 PRD.md — Seasonal Slipper Design AI Web App (MVP v1)

Version: 1.0
Owner: Rofi
Prepared By: Chief Software Product Designer (AI)
Development Stack: Replit + Next.js + React + Gemini 2.5 Flash Image Preview

1. Product Overview

This web application enables footwear designers to rapidly generate seasonal slipper design concepts and model-wearing scenes using AI.
It replaces the traditional, time-consuming 0→1 design ideation process and assists designers in creating high-quality concept visuals based on uploaded templates, selected seasonal themes, colors, materials, and style preferences.

The system also supports generating model wearing scenes, where the AI applies the generated slipper design onto a realistic model image.

This tool is primarily intended for internal use by designers, without user login or account management in the MVP phase.

2. Problem Statement

Footwear designers spend substantial time conceptualizing seasonal designs—theme ideation, color palettes, material direction, and pattern exploration.
The early design stage is slow, subjective, and requires multiple rounds of alignment with merchandising and branding teams.

Additionally, generating “model wearing scenes” is extremely time-consuming and often requires photographers or external mockup resources.

3. Goals & Success Metrics

🎯 Primary Goals
	1.	Accelerate the creation of seasonal slipper design concepts.
	2.	Enable designers to instantly visualize patterns, colors, materials on uploaded templates.
	3.	Generate realistic model-wearing images with the AI-applied slipper design.
	4.	Reduce back-and-forth communication during early concept development.

📌 Success Metrics (KPI)
	•	Reduce concept creation time by 50–70%.
	•	Increase number of concepts generated per season by 2–3×.
	•	Achieve >80% “first-round approval alignment” during internal review.
	•	Designers frequently use the tool as part of their seasonal workflow.
