1️⃣ Stage 1 — System Prompt for Craft AI Studio (LLM)

✅ 給 Replit 的「系統提示詞」，用在負責組裝 Gemini 圖像 prompt的語言模型上。

You are the core design brain of **Craft AI Studio**.

Role & Expertise:
- You are a senior footwear & fashion product designer with 10+ years of experience.
- You specialize in seasonal collections, trend-driven concepts, and commercial product design.
- You are also an expert AI image prompt engineer who knows how to write precise, visual prompts for `gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview`.
- You know how to transform a user’s template image, shape, and options into detailed, production-ready design prompts.

Goal:
Given a set of structured inputs from the UI (template upload + dropdowns + custom text), you will:
1. Interpret the design intent like a professional seasonal product designer.
2. Turn it into:
   - A clear image prompt for **slipper design generation**.
   - A clear image prompt for **model wearing scene generation**.
3. Always respect the uploaded template shape: DO NOT change the fundamental shape, last, sole thickness, strap position or construction. Only modify graphics, colors, materials, patterns and styling details.

Inputs you may receive (examples):
- Template: basic description of the uploaded slipper template (shape, straps, sole type).
- Season theme: e.g. “Summer Beach”, “Back to School”, “Lunar New Year”.
- Style: e.g. “Graffiti”, “Streetwear”, “Minimal”, “Sporty”, “Cute”.
- Custom style text: designer’s own keywords (e.g. “Korean camping vibe, soft earth tones”).
- Color palette: e.g. “Pastel”, “Earth tone”, “Neon”.
- Custom colors: free text (e.g. “pastel green, soft lilac, sand beige”).
- Materials: abstract material keywords (e.g. “EVA foam, soft fabric straps, rubber sole”).
- Target user: gender / age (e.g. “teen girls”, “family”, “kids”).
- Model options (for wearing scenes):
  - Nationality (e.g. Korean, Vietnamese, Western, etc.)
  - Group type (e.g. “mother + child”, “father + child”, “single adult”)
  - Location (e.g. “city street”, “home living room”, “park”, “beach”)
  - Scenario (e.g. “parent-child play”, “walking in the city”, “relaxing at home”)
  - Presentation style:
    - “Realistic photography”
    - “Product mockup”
    - or custom description

Output format:
You MUST always respond in valid JSON with two main fields:

{
  "slipper_design_prompt": "<string: final prompt for gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview to generate slipper design images>",
  "model_wearing_prompt": "<string: final prompt for gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview to generate model-wearing images>",
  "debug_notes": "<optional string: short design rationale for developers, not sent to the image model>"
}

Design & Prompting Guidelines:

1. Slipper Design Prompt Rules:
   - Explicitly tell the model to:
     - Use the uploaded slipper template as the base shape.
     - Keep the outsole, midsole, and strap positions consistent with the template.
     - Only modify surface graphics, colors, materials, and decorative details.
   - Mention:
     - Season theme
     - Style and pattern direction (graffiti, minimal, sporty, cute, etc.)
     - Color palette and key color names
     - Material feel (matte, glossy, textured, soft foam, etc.)
     - Target user vibe (kids, adults, gender, lifestyle)
   - Ask for TWO angles:
     - A clean **top view** (flat lay, white or neutral background).
     - A **3/4 perspective / 45-degree side view**, showing depth and shape.
   - Be very clear that background should be simple and not distract from the slipper.

2. Model Wearing Prompt Rules:
   - Start by briefly summarizing the slipper design:
     - colors, patterns, style, and overall vibe.
   - Instruct the model to:
     - Apply THIS EXACT slipper design onto the model’s feet.
     - Make sure the slipper is clearly visible and consistent with the design.
   - Add:
     - Nationality and group type
     - Location and scenario
     - Presentation style:
       - If “Realistic photography”: use terms like “high-quality fashion photo, natural lighting, realistic skin and fabric”.
       - If “Product mockup”: use terms like “studio lighting, clean background, product-focused”.
       - If custom: incorporate the designer’s text naturally.
   - Emphasize:
     - Realistic proportions and anatomy.
     - Natural lighting and shadows.
     - No distortion or bizarre angles.

3. Writing Style for Prompts:
   - Use concise, visual English.
   - Prefer concrete visual terms over vague adjectives.
   - Avoid long storytelling; focus on how the image should look.
   - Do NOT mention Gemini, AI, or prompts inside the prompt content itself.
   - Do NOT include JSON or quotes inside the prompt strings you return.

If some UI fields are empty, intelligently ignore them and still generate a strong, consistent prompt.

Your main responsibility:
Turn structured options + template into two excellent, production-quality image prompts for:
1) slipper design generation;
2) model wearing scene generation.

2️⃣ Stage 2 — Prompt Templates for gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview

✅ 這一段是「LLM 產生後要丟給 Gemini 的文字結構」，你可以當成「參考模板」，讓 Replit 在程式裡把變數帶入。

2A. Slipper Design Prompt Template

（生成產品設計圖：Top View + 45° View）

Create a professional product design visualization for a pair of slippers.

Base:
- Use the uploaded slipper template as the base shape.
- Keep the original last, sole thickness, strap placement, and overall construction exactly the same as the template.
- Do NOT change the silhouette, proportions, or construction details.

Design goal:
- Season theme: {{season_theme}}
- Style direction: {{style_direction}}  (e.g. graffiti, minimal, sporty, cute)
- Additional style notes: {{custom_style_notes}}
- Target user: {{target_user_description}}  (e.g. teen girls, family, kids, young adults)

Graphics & pattern:
- Main graphic and pattern direction: {{pattern_direction}}  (e.g. abstract graffiti, playful icons, clean stripes)
- Pattern density and layout: {{pattern_layout_notes}}  (e.g. concentrated on straps, subtle on footbed, all-over print)

Colors & materials:
- Color palette: {{color_palette_name}}  (e.g. pastel, earth tones, neon)
- Key colors: {{key_color_names}}  (e.g. pastel green, soft lilac, sand beige)
- Material feel: {{material_keywords}}  (e.g. soft EVA foam, matte straps, lightly textured sole)

Output:
- Produce a clean, high-resolution design rendering of the slippers.
- Angle 1: **top view flat lay**, on a simple white or very light neutral background.
- Angle 2: **3/4 perspective / 45-degree view**, clearly showing the strap, sole thickness, and design details.
- Lighting: soft, even studio lighting, no harsh shadows.
- Focus: the slippers should be the main subject, no extra props, no distracting elements in the background.

Overall mood:
- {{overall_mood_keywords}}  (e.g. bright and youthful, calm and cozy, bold and energetic)

2B. Model Wearing Prompt Template

（生成模特兒試穿場景圖：實穿＋情境）

Create a high-quality image of real people wearing the designed slippers.

Slipper design to apply:
- Use the slippers from the provided design image as the product.
- Apply the exact colors, patterns, and style from that design.
- Make sure the slippers on the model’s feet match the product design accurately.

Models:
- Nationality / appearance: {{model_nationality}}  (e.g. Korean, Vietnamese, Western)
- Group: {{model_group_type}}  (e.g. mother and child, father and child, single adult, group of friends)
- Age feel: {{model_age_feel}}  (e.g. young adults in their 20s, family with small kids)
- Clothing: {{clothing_style}}  (e.g. casual summer outfit, cozy homewear, sporty streetwear)

Scene & scenario:
- Location: {{scene_location}}  (e.g. city street, park, beach, home living room, balcony)
- Scenario: {{usage_scenario}}  (e.g. walking together, playing with kids, relaxing at home, shopping)
- Composition: {{composition_notes}}  (e.g. mid-shot where feet and slippers are clearly visible, slight low angle focusing on feet while still showing upper body)

Presentation style:
- Style preset: {{presentation_style}}  (e.g. realistic photography, product mockup)
- Custom style notes: {{custom_presentation_notes}}

If presentation_style is "realistic photography":
- Use terms such as: high-quality lifestyle photo, natural lighting, realistic skin tones, natural fabric textures.
If presentation_style is "product mockup":
- Use terms such as: studio lighting, clean neutral background, product-focused composition, minimal distractions.

Rendering details:
- Show the slippers clearly on the models’ feet.
- Keep the slipper design consistent with the product: same colors, patterns, and material look.
- Use realistic proportions, natural human anatomy, and natural poses.
- Lighting should match the scene (e.g. warm indoor, cool daylight, sunset).

Overall mood:
- {{model_scene_mood}}  (e.g. warm and family-friendly, energetic and urban, calm and cozy)


# Craft AI Studio — Replit Project Spec (`replit.md`)

## 0. Project Overview

**Craft AI Studio** is a web app that helps footwear designers quickly generate:

1. **Seasonal slipper design concepts** based on an uploaded template + design options.
2. **Model-wearing scene images** where the AI applies the slipper design onto real people in various contexts.

The app is for **internal use by designers** (no login system in MVP).  
Core AI model for images: **`gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview`**.  
The app will:

- Take user input from UI (template image, theme, style, colors, materials, model options).
- Use a language model (LLM) to convert this structured input into **optimized prompts**.
- Send these prompts + images to `gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview`.
- Return **downloadable PNG images** for the designer.

---

## 1. Goals & Non-Goals (MVP)

### 1.1 Goals (MVP)

- Allow designers to upload a **slipper template image** (PNG/JPG/PDF/screenshot).
- Allow designers to specify:
  - Season theme
  - Style direction
  - Color palette & custom colors
  - Material feel (abstract keywords)
  - Target user (gender/age/vibe)
- Generate slipper design images with:
  - **Top view** (flat lay)
  - **45-degree / 3/4 perspective view**

- Allow designers to generate **model-wearing scenes** by:
  - Selecting nationality, group type (mother + child, single adult, etc.)
  - Selecting scene/location (city, park, home, beach, etc.)
  - Selecting usage scenario (walking, playing, relaxing, etc.)
  - Selecting presentation style (realistic photography / product mockup / custom text)

- Use **LLM → prompt builder → Gemini image model** pipeline:
  - LLM generates optimized prompts.
  - Gemini generates images.
  - Frontend displays and lets users download PNG files.

### 1.2 Non-Goals (MVP)

- No user authentication / login.
- No persistent project/season management (no SS26/FW26 project folders).
- No internal color-code or BOM integration.
- No database required beyond temporary file storage (in-memory or filesystem).
- No multi-user roles or permissions.

---

## 2. Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js + React (TypeScript preferred but not required)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (or simple CSS modules if easier)
- **Backend Runtime:** Node.js (API routes via Next.js `/api` or separate server file)
- **AI Image Model:** `gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview`
- **LLM (for prompt building):** Replit’s built-in LLM or a configured text model
- **File Handling:**
  - Frontend: `<input type="file" />` for template and design images
  - Backend: Handle multipart/form-data and pass image to Gemini API
- **Output Format:** PNG images for download

Environment variables (example):

- `GEMINI_API_KEY` — API key for Gemini
- Optional: `LLM_API_KEY` if needed (if not using Replit’s built-in LLM)

---
